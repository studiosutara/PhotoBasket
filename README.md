This was an app created for [Google iOS hackathon](https://sites.google.com/site/ioshackathon2013/) in 2013.

The application downloads images using Picasa web APIs and populates them in a UICollectionView.

The scrolling speed for the application is determined by the tilt angle of the device. 

The tilt angle is determined using the Core Motion library.
